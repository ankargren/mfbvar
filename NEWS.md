# mfbvar 0.5.1 (2019-08-16)
* Support for more priors
* Stochastic volatility models
* Better `predict` functions
* Faster implementations
* Some support for quarterly/monthly (i.e. single-frequency) models
* Vignette added

# TODO
* Impulse responses
* Marginal data densities for more specifications (currently `minn`-`iw` with `average` only), and in C++
* Enable use of less lags than what the aggregations need
